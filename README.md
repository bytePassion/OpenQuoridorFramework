OpenQuoridorFramework is a set of libraries and applications to create bots for Quoridor, play against them and do a lot more cool stuff around Quoridor.

In this Version the OQF comes with two applications:
- PlayerVsBot:  An application to play (as human) against an OQF-Bot
- ReplayViewer: An application to analize (review) a past game

---

To write a OQF-Bot you have to implement the IQuoridorBot-Inteface which can be found at OQF.Bot.Contracts. You can get more detailed information from the help-pages of PlayerVsBot.

An examplary implementation is the SimpleWalkingBot which is also part of this version of OQF.
